# The-Weather-Forcast

## Description

In today's day in age, we have been relying on technology to help us with certain tasks. We are able to check on our phones what the weather will be like that do or week. Being able to build a weather app from scratch is a good way to build up skill as a programmer. Its also nice to see what the temperature, wind and humidity will be as well. I learned how to incorporate localStorage, use a weather API, practice JavaScript skills to get the application to function.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user is able to search for a city to be able to find out the current temperature, wind, humidity along with the five day forecast.

I have attached a link to the deployed application https://aldoibuado.github.io/The-Weather-Forcast/
